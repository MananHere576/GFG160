class Solution
{
    static void pushZerosToEnd(int[] arr) 
    {
        int f = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) 
        {
            if (arr[i] != 0) 
            {
                int temp = arr[i];
                arr[i] = arr[f];
                arr[f] = temp;
                f++;
            }
        }
    }
}

However, on encountering a non-zero element, instead of directly placing the non-zero element at arr[count], we will swap the non-zero element with arr[count]. This will ensure that if there is any zero present at arr[count], it is pushed towards the end of array and is not overwritten.
